# Disney+ Hotstar Clone: An Experience on a Streaming PlatformSummary


To replicate the immersive experience of one of India's most well-known over-the-top (OTT) services, I created a frontend clone of the Disney+ Hotstar streaming platform. This project accurately replicates the interactive features and visual style that draw millions of users to Hotstar.

# What I've Produced

A dynamic landing page with auto-scrolling media sliders and smooth hover effects that display video previews are two of the clone's features.
A simple, useful login page; content arranged using the latest CSS Grid by franchises (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.)
The design is completely responsive and compatible with all devices.

# Behind the Scenes

The project is powered by the following technologies: **HTML5** for a strong page structure; **CSS3** for stunning responsive layouts, grids, and animations; and **JavaScript** for adding interactive elements to the interface.
